# CaseFlow: A Prosecutor's Case Management Tool

## Overview
The Case Management System is a console-based application designed to help prosecutors manage case information and court dates more efficiently. This project was developed to transition from a manual, paper-based system to a digital solution. It allows users to upload cases, manage postponement dates, view daily court cases, search through cases, and track older and completed cases.

## Features
- **Add Cases:** Easily add new cases with details such as case number, defendant name, charges, and court dates.
- **View Cases:** See a comprehensive list of all cases, including their status and upcoming court dates.

## Planned Features
- **Export Cases:** Export case data to various formats for analysis or archiving.
- **Manage Postponement Dates**: Update and manage the postponement dates for each case.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for cases using specific search terms to quickly find relevant information.
- **View Older Cases**: View cases that are older than six months.
- **Completed Cases**: Indicate and view which cases have already been completed.
